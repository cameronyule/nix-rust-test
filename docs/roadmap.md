# Roadmap

* Integrate building directly, as opposed to dropping to `nix develop`.
  * E.g., Fenix can be used with `naersk` or `buildRustPackage` ([examples](https://github.com/nix-community/fenix?tab=readme-ov-file#examples))
* Demonstrate how to handle Cargo dependencies.
* Demonstrate how to specify build and run-time dependencies provided by Nix.
